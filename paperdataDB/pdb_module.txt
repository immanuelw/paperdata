The paperdataDB module is a wrapper around the paperdata MySQL database and
table *paperdata*. This module supplies functions to allow the user to more
easily (without knowledge of SQL syntax) search for specific information
within the paperdata database and table.

Input is in the format of list of lists, with each list pertaining to a field:
[field_name, search_field_constant, field_range_specifier, field_range_list]

A list of lists is made from these building blocks and that is the input into
the main function of the module.

EXAMPLE:
>>> info_list = [['era', NOSEARCH, EXACT, [32]], ['path', SEARCH, NONE, []],
['julian_day', SEARCH, RANGE, [922, 935]]]

Functions (must be paperdataDB.paperdataDB.function_name):

paperdataDB.paperdataDB.fetch(info_list)
	Returns a SQL string which can be used to find the information that is
	being searched for in any MySQL module or program.

paperdataDB.paperdataDB.dbsearch(query, password)
	Returns a list of information depending on the query input into the
	function. Simple MySQLdb wrapper to only search queries.


>>> import paperdataDB.paperdataDB as pdb
>>> db_information = pdb.dbsearch(pdb.fetch(info_list), password)

With db_information being a list of all the information requested.
