db_update.sh simply shows how to run alembic (which is used to automatically update the database through python), unclear why it doesn't work on command line
**certain files have observations discrepancies -- julian date or start time don't match filename, polarization in filename differs from database entry and possibly value in file**
jd_count.py and jdpol_count.py on pot4 count the amount of files in each day and polarization on pot4 from the kroll disks, output files already on there
parsing of off host files incomplete, explained in BUGS file
pot4:/mnt/ThomasJefferson/data/psa*, pot4:/mnt/WilliamHenryHarrison/data/psa* both have some empty directories -- is this intentional?
